# School Work Graveyard 📚👻⚰️

Where college projects go to die... probably.  
Beware zombies. 🧟🧟‍♂️🧟‍♀️

## What Is This Repo?

This is an archive of my software engineering projects. Some projects are big, some small, and some are ungraded little tests or explorations of an idea that didn't go anywhere.

Browse freely, but if you're a student NO CHEATING! All code here is being provided as a sample of my work and coding style only. If I am ever made aware of any copying or plagiarism of my work I will inform your school without hesitation.

## Running My Code

I make no promises that anything in this archive will continue to work for any period of time. Each project *should* work "out of the box" as most were self-contained school assignments, however this repo should be considered to be a collection of read-only abandonware. I have no plans to maintain any of this work, though I may revisit some pieces in time, rebuilding them with new tools, or approaching the problems they tackled from a new angle. 🧟
