# The Final
---

Here is a repository in which you can gather all your materials together for your final. A reminder as to what should be included in here:
* 1-2 Python programs wherein you showcase your ability to achieve a total of 18 of the 25 learning objectives provided on the webpage.
* A summary for each program, where you describe what problem the program was meant to solve, what learning objectives the program showcases, and on _what line number(s) each of those objectives were demonstrated_! These summaries should be included here as a simple pdf or text file. Please no Microsoft Word or similar type files.
* Any other supplemental material your script needs to run (data files, text files, images, etc). Make sure to upload these so that I can run your script the exact same way you could!

There should be submitted by the end of Friday, May 7. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask, but otherwise please work independently on these.

Thank you all for the wonderful semester!
